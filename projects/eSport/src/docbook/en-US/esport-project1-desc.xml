            eLeague is planning an on-line league site that will allow league
            coordinators to organize teams into divisions, schedule contests,
            and track scores. At the same time, eClub is planning an on-line club
            management site that will allow clubs to organize players, coaches,
            and managers into teams. eClub is designing their software such that it
            can be used with eLeague.
        </para>
  
        <para>
            For eLeague, the coordinator starts by adding clubs and their
            primary point of contact.  Venues and Teams are added to the league by
            club coordinators.  Contacts (e.g., coach(s), manager(s), etc.) are
            added for teams.  Prior to the start of the season, the league will
            create a new set of divisions and assign teams to the appropriate
            divisions for that season.  Divisions are arranged by group (e.g.,
            U11, Bantam, Masters, etc.) and level (e.g., AA, A, 1, 2, etc.).
            The league will then schedule contests for each division, matching
            a home and away team with a venue from the home team's club. For
            simplicity, we'll assume that the venue is exclusively available for
            scheduling by the league, but the league still must manage scheduling
            conflicts for the venue contests within the league. Scores are added
            for the home and away team after each contest. A team schedule and
            division standings will be generated from the information.
        </para>
  
        <para>
            For eClub, individuals register with the site, supplying basic
            information. For simplicity, we'll keep eClub to minimal information.
            The individuals can be players or parents and/or coaches. There is
            additional information tracked for players and coaches.  Players will
            need a position and jersey number. Coaches need a certification
            number.  Parents/guardians will need no further information.  After
            tryouts, the club will create a set of teams and assign a head coach,
            a manager, and players. The team and team points of contact will
            be used to form a registration with eLeague. From the club site, a team
            can get roster information, game schedules, and division standings.
            The schedules and division standings are obtained from eLeague and 
            and are not duplicated within eClub to make sure they are up to date.
        </para>
  
        <para>
            Both eLeague and eClub have come to you to develop the initial phase
            of their applications. You are tasked with implementing a low-cost
            prototype, based on current standards, to automated much of this 
            activity. At this point in the project we are primarily looking to 
            build the data access tiers for both eLeague and eClub (two 
            separate systems). We will also add a minor amount of business 
            logic to coordinate the data access between the individual data 
            access objects.
        </para>


        <para>
	    For eLeague, the system is initialized with a starting
	    set of information pertaining to clubs (league's external
	    view), contacts, venues, and a season defined with
	    divisions and teams.  New information can be added and
	    updated.
        </para>

        <para>
            For eClub, the system is initialized with an empty database that
            is designed to hold internal club information for teams, coaches,
            and players. The teams will be assigned a division within the league
            and individuals associated with the team will be interested in 
            seeing scores and standings relative to their team.

        <title>Technical Overview</title>
        <para>
            The work done during this project focuses on the business objects
            (BOs), the data access objects (DAOs) of the data access tier,
            some initial business logic interfaces (BL), and business
            logic implementations (BLImpl). The DAOs will be based on the 
            Java Persistence API (JPA). How you partition the implementations
            of your projects is up to you. A candidate starting point is provided
            at the end of this project description.
        </para>
        <note>
            <title>Think big for eLeague, Think small/quick for eClub</title>
            <para>
                There will be many choices while creating your solution to the two 
                applications. It is intended that you always approach the eLeague application
                as "it is hard" and requires extra formal layers. To provide contrast,
                it is intended that you always approach the eClub application as 
                "it is simple" and target as many simplification and shortcuts in the 
                architectural layers as you can find. The point of this is for you to gain
                experience with the different approaches and to not make eClub a 
                tedious clone of approaches taken in eLeague. The spec will describe both in a 
                similar manner, but you should apply more of a "right approach" based 
                on what was just stated.
            </para>
        </note>

        <para>
            The business objects encapsulate the core business data and rules
            of the application. You will design the business objects and then
            map them to the database.  You are required to implement 
            CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) capability with JPA but 
            you only need to implement the CRUD methods that are necessary to 
            complete the provided end-to-end scenario. 
            You will be required to encapsulate
            all object to relational (O/R) mapping within the DAOs, descriptor
            files, and/or class metadata annotations.  You will be given a set of
            <ulink url="https://raw.github.com/ejavaguy/ejava-student/master/projects/eSport/eSportData/eLeagueTestUtil/src/main/resources/xml/eLeague-all.xml">
            test data</ulink>
            to initially populate your applications and be the source
            of data for the ingest requirement. To use the data, you will ingest 
            using a parser supplied by the instructor. There is a sample thread
            in the projects/eSport/eSales directory that shows how to use the 
            parser as well as other aspects technology within the project.  
        </para>
  
        <para>
            The database will have a functional schema and indexes to provide 
            query performance. Business objects will be validated in the database
            using schema constraints and within the JVM using the Validation API.
        </para>
  
        <para>
            The business logic will provide a set of classes with concise methods
            that map easily to the provided end-to-end scenario. The business logic will ensure proper
            use of the overall application, delegating some business logic
            functionality to the business objects and full O/R responsibility
            to the DAOs. eLeague will have an ingest requirement as well as the
            requirement to manipulate and add to what was ingested. eClub will
            start fresh and obtain all data from users and coordinate with eLeague. 
            However, for project 1, eClub will be unable to fully implement 
            data exchange with eLeague because remote interfaces will not be
            implemented until project2.  Some of that must be stubbed at this point. 
            You are only required to implement enough business logic methods
            that it takes to implement the end-to-end scenarios specified later
            within this specification.
        </para>

        <para>
            The test acceptance for the first project will be the unit tests and
            an integration test that takes the business logic, data access
            tier, and business objects through a provided end-to-end scenario
            that will be consistent during the semester. You are required to 
            supply the following tests:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
            <listitem><para>A unit test that implements the steps of the provided eLeague end-to-end scenario</para> </listitem>
            <listitem><para>A unit test that implements the steps of the provided eClub end-to-end scenario</para> </listitem>
            <listitem><para>At least one unit test per architectural layer (BO, DAO, BL) that demonstrates 
                your ability to test at that level.</para> </listitem>

            <para>
                The amount of work that you can implement within the
                bounds of this project spec could be endless if you
                attempted to account for everything and anything. It is
                very important that you limit your work to only what
                is necessary to implement (and test) the functionality
                required for the end-to-end scenario. That means you may
                have entities that are designed to be created but never
                modified while having other entities that go through
                a full lifecycle. When deciding to add or skip certain
                capabilities -- always ask yourself "does the business
                logic need this behavior to implement the end-to-end
                scenario".

            Since the work is for separate applications, we will need to establish
            two separate application projects for this work; eSales and eBidbot.
            The development can physically share resources (e.g., same database
            and application server), but should be easily separated. It is
            suggested that you form a root for the overall eMarket work to
            coordinate integration testing, and then group the lower-level
            work under two child projects; eSales and eBidbot.  See some
            suggested project layouts at the bottom of this specification.  A
            <ulink url="https://github.com/ejavaguy/ejava-student/tree/master/projects/eMarket">
            sample set of projects</ulink> that implement a thin eSales thread has
            been made available. Please ignore the TestData sub-project when
            using the example to craft your source tree. You will depend on
            projects within that tree -- not re-implement them and not copy
            them.  See the Getting Started section towards the end of this 
            specification for a more detailed sample project layout.
        </para>

        <note>
            <para>
                You will likely copy significant portions of the thin thread
                example and other class examples into your project. Be aware that
                the thin thread and other example pom.xml files inherit from 
                the class root project that provides dependencyManagement and 
                pluginManagement duties. You will either need to also inherit from
                the dependencies/pom.xml or compensate by re-defining the management
                sections in the root pom.xml of your project.
            </para>
        </note>
  
        <para>
            Since students in the class will be producing parallel implementations for
            the applications and submitting them for evaluation, it is asked
            that you come up with unique names for your artifacts. This could
            be done by replacing the "e" in eMarket, eSales, and eBidbot with a
            unique name that corresponds to your newsgroup or college login
            (ex.  jcsMarket, jcsSales, jcsBidbot). You should also use this same pattern for
            java packages (ex. jcs.sales, jcs.bitbot), DB tables (e.g., JCS_), etc.
        </para>
  
        <para>
            There should be no use of System.out.println() in the code and all
            implementations must use a logging API with log4j as the logging provider.  
            You may leave debug in your code, but this 
            should be able to be turned on/off with the proper logging priority
            changes in the log4j.xml configuration.
