    <title>Project 1 Getting Started</title>
    <para>
        The following sketch of two directory structures can be used as a
        starting point for your overall application. The first is a simplified
        project layout that collapses the number of sub-projects into a single
        "Impl" project. It is suggested that you use this layout if you
        are new to maven and want the simplest configuration possible. The
        second is a more robust layout and is closer to a multi-developer
        environment.  Use the later structure if you want to better simulate a
        work environment where the work of multiple developers needs clearer
        separation. 
    </para>

    <note>
        <para>
            All "e"Sport, "e"League, and "e"Club names
            should be changed to your specific name mangler. The same type of
            modification needs to occur for the java package names.
        </para>

    <note>
        <para>
            Other than a README, it is not anticipated that you will have 
            other artifacts at the root layer. The root pom.xml should be
            used only as a convenience wrapper to perform goals across both
            projects. The root project can also be used for common property, 
            dependencyManagement, and pluginManagement defintions. All 
            concrete dependency and plugins should be defined in the leaf-level
            poms to avoid unwanted dependencies from the root or mid-level
            parents.

          <title>Project 1 persistence.xml definitions are for test</title>
          <para>
            Since the work of project 1 will be deployed to the application
            server in follow-on projects, the persistence.xml definitions 
            created in project 1 should be considered strictly for test and 
            should be placed in the "src/test" tree to prevent it from 
            being deployed to the application server. It is also suggested
            that if your persistence unit is called "X", the persistence 
            unit name for project 1 in the "src/test" tree be called "X-test"
            to avoid confusion of what is intended to be used.
