    <name>Class Projects Root</name>
    <description>
        This project is the root project for class project artifacts.
        It contains test data generators and examples for getting started
        with the class project. As a general rule, the test data is not
        to be re-implemented by the student. You will re-use the instructor-provided
        version as a pre-compiled resource. You will implement your 
        version of the sample application found here that uses that test
        data. Use the sample application as a good source of solving some of the 
        Maven setup required to create your implementation of the class project.
