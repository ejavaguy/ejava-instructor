    <title>Project 2 Grading</title>
    <para>
        Your project will be graded on completeness and quality of product. In
        order for you to receive full credit in each area, it must be a)
        complete, b) done well, and c) tested.  The breakdown of grading 
        will be as follows:

    <para>
        The following table contains examples of where projects have lost 
        points in the past. Of course, each project submitted can introduce
        new issues or different severity levels of the same issues. Do not
        treat this as a complete list.
