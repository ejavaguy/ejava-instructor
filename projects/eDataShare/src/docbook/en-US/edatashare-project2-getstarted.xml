    <title>Project 2 Getting Started</title>
    <para>
        The following sketch of directory structure can be used as a starting
        point for your overall application. It assumes you already have either
        a consolidated Impl -or- a BO, DAO, and BLImpl set of projects in
        place from Project 1. You will not have the option of consolidating
        the EJB, WAR, EAR, and RMI Test into a single project for DMV. They must be
        implemented as separate projects with proper dependencies between
        them declared. You *do* have the option of merging all modules
        into a single WAR module for Mayberry or many of the alternatives
        as long as Mayberry is deployed as a WAR.
        Note that all "e"DataShare, "e"Dmv, and "e"Mayberry names
        should be changed to your specific name mangler. The same type of
        modification needs to occur for the java package names.
