    <title>Ready Project for Import into Eclipse</title>
    <para>
        Over the years/versions, Eclipse has progressed from being ignorant of Maven
        (with all integration coming from the Maven side) to being very much integrated
        with Maven. In that later/integrated mode, Eclipse will try really hard to 
        do the right thing within Eclipse for what was defined to be done outside 
        of Eclipse. For example, Eclipse will turn Maven dependencies directly into
        an Eclipse build path. There exists, however, some plugins that Eclipse 
        has yet to learn about and will alert you to that fact. Many of these 
        have no role within Eclipse and you simply need to explicitly give Eclipse
        instruction to ignore the plugin. Luckily these cases get fewer and fewer 
        each year and Eclipse will update your pom.xml with the necessary configuration
        when it is needed.

    <para>
        In this chapter we will practively tell Eclipse to ignore the sql-maven-plugin
        but feel free to wait until Eclipse complains (Who knows, there may be an update
        that makes this step unecessary).
