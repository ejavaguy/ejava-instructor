    <title>Git Client Setup</title>
    <para>
        You will use Git in this class to perform an initial checkout and
        get updates for source files. Any Git client should be able to perform
        that function. You can determine if you have a command line Git 
        client already installed using the following simple command.

                    Eclipse GUI Users: There is a git plugin for
                    Eclipse available called EGit. It automatically comes with
                    Eclipse these days, so no extra installation is required.

                        There are many modules within the class repository.
                        Some are ready for use, some are still being worked,
                        and some are not for use this semester.
                        The ones ready for your use will be wired into the 
                        build and will be compiled during a follow-on section.
                        The list will increase as the semester moves forward. 
                        Please ignore these extra modules. Keeping them within
                        the baseline helps me keep related things centralized.
