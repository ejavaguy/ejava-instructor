        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            This course covers enterprise
            computing technologies using Java Enterprise Edition
            (Java EE). The course describes how to build multitier
            distributed applications, specifically addressing web
            access, business logic, data access, and applications
            supporting enterprise service technologies. For the web
            access tier, the focus will be on integrating the web
            tier with enterprise applications. For the business logic
            tier, session beans for synchronous business processing
            and message-driven beans and timers for asynchronous
            business processing will be described. The data access
            tier discussion will focus on data access patterns and the
            Java Persistence API. Finally, enterprise services will
            be discussed, including the 
            Bean Validation API, 
            Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), 
            Dependency Injection for Java (JSR-330), 
            Context and Dependency Injection for JavaEE (CDI; JSR-299), 
            remote method invocation (RMI), 
            Java API for XML Binding (JAXB), and 
            Java API for RESTful Wed Services (JAX-RS),
            Java Transaction API (JTA), 
            Java EE security, 
            and Java Message Service (JMS).
            Students will build applications using the technologies
            presented.
        </para>
        <para>
            The material currently covers standards adopted as of 
            JavaEE 6 (JPA 2.0, EJB 3.1, and JMS 1.1) and is being actively updated with information
            from JavaEE 7 (JPA 2.1, EJB 3.2, and JMS 2.0). The development environment used in class
            is JavaSE 7 and JavaEE 7-compliant.
        </para>
        <para>
            Using modern development tools, commercial persistence providers, and application servers, students will
            design and implement several significant programming projects using the above mentioned technologies and
            deploy them to a Java EE environment that they will manage.

        <para>
            This course will make heavy use of development tools
            (Git, Maven 3, JUnit, Log4j, and Eclipse), a database 
            (H2 Database Engine), persistence provider
            (Hibernate), and application server (JBoss/Wildfly 8). 
            Students are strongly encouraged to establish a local
            development environment. Detailed instructions for setup are
            part of the first exercise (Development Environment Setup).

            The core of the EJB 3.1 content is covered in the primary text for

            topics (database schema, JDBC, Web Tier, JMS, and tools) are not 
            covered in the course text, but documentation will be provided 
            through course slides, examples, and tutorials. A list of online 
            references can be found on this site. Each lecture will supply a 
            list of references for that technical area.

                    Class/newsgroup participation will be based on instructor 
                    judgment whether the student has made a contribution to class
                    to either the classroom or newsgroup on a consistent weekly basis.
                    A newsgroup contribution may be a well-formed technical observation/lesson 
                    learned, a well formed question that leads to a well formed follow up from 
                    another student, or a well formed answer/follow-up to another student's 
                    question. Well formed submissions are those that clearly summarize the 
                    topic in the subject, and clearly describe the objective, environment, 
                    and conditions in the body. The instructor will be the judge of whether 
                    a newsgroup contribution meets the minimum requirements for the week. 
                    The intent of this requirment is to promote public collaboration 
                    between class members.

                    The intent of this requirement is to promote early, more-focused

            Collaboration of ideas and approaches are strongly encouraged. You may use partial 
            solutions provided by others as a part of your project submission. However, the bulk 
            usage of another students implementation or project will result in a 0 for the project. 
            There is a difference between sharing ideas/code snippets and turning in someone 
            else's work as your own. When in doubt, document your sources.

            I am available at least 20min before class, breaks, and most times after class 
            for extra discussion. I provide detailed answers to project and technical questions 
            through the <ulink url="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ejava_class">course newsgroup</ulink>. 
            You can get individual, non-technical questions 
            answered via <ulink url="mailto:jim.stafford@jhu.edu">e-mail</ulink>. 
            I usually have all questions posted by 9pm answered by 
            COB that evening. Students needing further assistance are also welcome 
            make other arrangements during the week.
