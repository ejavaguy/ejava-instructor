                This book contains the course syllabus for Developing 
                the Service Tier with JavaEE/EJB and JBoss/Wildfly.
                The course meets weekly via web-ex. Class attendance is 
                required for credit. Sessions are recorded for make-up work. 
                Exercises are provided but nothing is required to be turned
                in. You are welcome to seek additional assistance from the 
                instructor before or after class and any time via e-mail.

                A "week 0" is conducted prior to the course to  give 
                students (and the instructor) a change to verify
                their access to the webex and course materials and 
                take care of any pre-course pre-requisites. The assignments
                for that week are geared at getting your development 
                environment up and running and to provide a Maven primer
                for those not familar with Maven. All topics discussed 
                during week 0 will be generally applicable to JavaSE
                development and will not cover details that are specific
                to the course. This is all about getting ready...

                The remainder of the course will meet weekly for six sessions
                and will focus on EJB topics within the JavaEE framework.
                We will use JBoss/Wildfly for examples and exercises. The 
                Eclipse IDE is also used, but other IDE's should be usable
                in class and instructions will be highly Maven-based and 
                avoid IDE specifics where possible.

                The technical platform for the course is JavaSE and 
                JavaEE 7. The course materials are up to date with
                JavaEE 6 with on-going updates to cover newer additions
                based on JavaEE 7.
