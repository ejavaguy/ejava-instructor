        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            This course covers the development of the service tier
            using JavaEE standards, focusing on Enterprise JavaBeans
            (EJB). It will cover characteristics required by a service
            tier and why we need EJB and technologies associated with
            EJB. This course covers development use cases related to
            building and deploying service tiers and deploying to a
            JavaEE application server. The student will make full use
            of Maven, and IDE (default is Eclipse) and an application
            server (JBoss/Wildfly) and a relational database (H2).
        </para>
        <para>
            The material currently covers standards adopted as of 
            JavaEE 6 (JPA 2.0, EJB 3.1, and JMS 1.1) and is being actively updated with information
            from JavaEE 7 (JPA 2.1, EJB 3.2, and JMS 2.0). The development environment used in class
            is JavaSE and JavaEE 7-compliant.
        </para>
        <para>
            Using modern development tools, commercial persistence providers, and application servers, students will
            design and implement several significant programming projects using the above mentioned technologies and
            deploy them to a Java EE environment that they will manage.

        <title>Student Background</title>
        <para>
            The course is open to all levels of interest in developing EJB solutions. Since there are no 
            required assignments or tests -- the student will have the freedom to get out of the course
            according to their experience level and the amount of work they put into it. However, the 
            course is specifically designed for students comfortable with JavaSE development and lectures 
            and exercises will be primarily geared at that level of audience.

        <para>
            This course will make heavy use of development tools
            (Git, Maven 3, JUnit, Log4j, and Eclipse), a database 
            (H2 Database Engine), persistence provider
            (Hibernate), and application server (JBoss/Wildfly 8). 
            Students are strongly encouraged to establish a local
            development environment. Detailed instructions for setup are
            part of the first exercise (Development Environment Setup).

            reference to them. All material will be available in example form
            froms this course.

            I am available 20-30min before and after class, e-mail, and more detailed assistance 
            upon request. I will try to start the web-ex at least 30min prior to class beginning
            and will keep it open until the last question has been addressed. I do not generally have
            access to the Internet during the work-day so most questions will be answered in the 
            morning and evening hours.
        </para>

            Please make use of the discussion board as much as possible. If you have a question
            -- it will likely be the same question over half the class also has or will have.
